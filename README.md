# ü™ø Fowl Weather

Honk! **Fowl Weather** is a goose-centric weather forecast website who not only gives you the latest weather ‚Äî but also tells you what to wear. Built with **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it integrates both **Open-Meteo** (for weather and location data) and **OpenAI** (for clothing advice).  

Try it out, get your forecast, and let the goose guide your fashion choices.

## AI Clothing Advice ‚Äì Prompt Challenges

It turns out that it‚Äôs easier said than done to get an AI goose to give accurate, useful clothing advice on the first try. Please note that when talking about OpenAI in this section, I may simply refer to it as ‚Äúthe goose‚Äù. You can find my OpenAI call in `netlify/functions/clothingAdvice.mts`. My final prompt (with some example data here to make this easier to read for humans) was:

```
 `
	Weather summary:
     Today's weather:
     - Max temp: 27¬∞C
     - Min temp: 24¬∞C
     - Conditions: Sunny
                     
    Give advice specifically for what they should wear today in 1 or 2 sentences without repeating information from the summary,
    speaking like a goose. Do not use emojis. The user tends to feel slightly colder than other people by about 2¬∞C,
    but make sure the clothing advice matches the actual weather summary.
    Don't give innapropriate suggestions for the temperature like a scarf in warm weather,
    or use innapropriate colloquialisms for cold weather like "stay cool".`
```

**The main challenges:**
- Getting the goose to **factor in user preferences** (e.g., ‚Äúruns hot‚Äù or ‚Äúruns cold‚Äù) without overcompensating (‚Äúwear a scarf in 27¬∞C‚Äù), or saying ‚Äústay cool‚Äù to a user who runs a little cold at an Antarctic research station. I had to be more explicit than simply saying ‚Äúthe user runs hot‚Äù, as the goose seemed to think this meant the user holds the fires of mordor inside of them, and thus could survive sub-zero tempertures with no shoes on.
- **Constraint composition and order** - Many models, especially the earlier one I am using here, have limited capacity to follow a large number of constraints consistently. It helps to make your your main instruction is very clear and near the beginning of your prompt, group related constraints int he same sentence, and don‚Äôt include constraints that don‚Äôt absolutely need to be there.
- **Keeping token use economical** - I acheived this through the use of an older model and efficient word choice. At this point, it‚Äôs well-known that even a simple ‚Äúplease‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù can rack up more tokens, as does any additional context or constraints. When adding a new constraint to address an issue with responses, it was important to look back on previous constraints. Did this new one overlap with something I had said previously? When adding new context, could I take away from somewhere else?

**What was surprisingly easy:**
- Asking it to speak like a goose - at least for the standards of this project. LLMs are pretty good at simple creative writing.

## Storybook

A small selection of components were tested in isolation using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). While not exhaustive, this was useful for refining UI details without running the full app.

Run Storybook locally:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
